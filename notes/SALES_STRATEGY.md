### Sales Conversation Framework (CLOSER Method)

**C - Clarify**: Why are you interested in better plant care?
**L - Label**: So you're struggling with keeping plants alive?
**O - Overview**: What have you tried before that didn't work?
**S - Sell**: Here's how we guarantee your plants will thrive...
**E - Explain**: Let me address your concerns...
**R - Reinforce**: You've made a great decision for your plants

### Best Case/Worst Case Close

**Script Template**:
"Let me ask you this - what's the best case scenario if you join GreenThumb today?

[Let them answer]

Right, you finally become confident with plants, your home looks amazing, and you stop wasting money on dead plants.

Now what's the worst case? You try it for 30 days, decide it's not for you, and get every penny back. You've essentially gotten professional plant guidance for free.

The only thing that's guaranteed is if you keep doing what you're doing now, you'll keep getting the same results. So what makes more sense?"

### Proof System

**Social Proof Collection**:

- Before/after plant photos from every customer
- Success story testimonials
- Video reviews and transformations
- Expert endorsements

**Proof Display Strategy**:

- Sales page: 50+ before/after photos
- Email sequences: Customer success stories
- Sales calls: "How much proof do you need to believe this works?"

### Objection Handling Scripts

**"It's too expensive"**:
"I understand price is a concern. Let me ask - how much have you spent on plants that died in the last year? Most people tell me $200-300. So you're essentially getting insurance for $79.99 that will save you $200+. Plus, if it doesn't work, you get your money back. What's expensive is continuing to kill plants."

**"I don't have time"**:
"That's exactly why you need this. Our AI does all the thinking for you. Instead of spending hours researching and worrying, you get 10 minutes per week of simple tasks. It actually saves you time while guaranteeing better results."

**"I'm not sure it will work for me"**:
"I totally get that skepticism. That's why we offer three different guarantees. If your plants don't improve, if you don't feel you got value, or if you're not happy for any reason, you get your money back. What specific concern do you have that our guarantees don't address?"
