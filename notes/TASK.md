## 🚀 DATABASE OPTIMIZATION - MATERIALIZED VIEWS

**DB-VIEW-001**: Create fully materialized plant views for filtering, autocomplete, and card display  
**Status:** 🟢 **NEW**  
**Owner:** Development Team  
**Description:**
We need to create two new materialized views to replace the current card views. These views will be fully materialized representations of the plants table, one for common names and one for scientific names. Each view should include all fields required for:

- Filtering (all filterable fields)
- Autocomplete (name fields)
- Card display (all card UI fields)

This will allow us to efficiently filter, search, and display plant cards directly from the materialized views, improving performance and scalability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] `plants_common_name` materialized view exists with all required fields
- [ ] `plants_scientific_name` materialized view exists with all required fields
- [ ] Both views support all current and planned filters
- [ ] Both views support autocomplete for their respective name fields
- [ ] Both views provide all data needed for card display
- [ ] Card, search, and filter queries use only these views (no fallback to full table)
- [ ] Views are indexed for fast search and filtering
- [ ] Views are refreshed on plant data changes

## 🎯 Launch Overview

**Core App Status:**

### ✅ COMPLETED - Garden-Based Plant Filtering (January 2025)

**GARDEN-FILTER-001**: Implement garden-based filtering for plants database  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - January 26, 2025  
**Owner:** Development Team  
**Description:** Implemented automatic garden condition filtering to reduce database clutter and personalize plant recommendations

**Implementation Summary:**

**New Features:**

- Created `useGardenFilters` hook to fetch user gardens and convert conditions to plant database filters
- Added `GardenFilterSelector` component for quick garden-based filtering
- Implemented automatic application of first garden's conditions as default filters
- Added personalization status indicator when garden filters are active
- Integrated garden-based quick filters with existing manual filter system

**Key Benefits:**

- **Reduced Clutter**: Plants are automatically filtered based on user's garden conditions
- **Personalized Experience**: Second a user creates their first garden, the app becomes more tailored
- **Quick Garden Switching**: Users with multiple gardens can quickly switch between garden-specific filters
- **Seamless Integration**: Works alongside existing manual filter system without conflicts

**Technical Implementation:**

- `lib/hooks/useGardenFilters.ts`: Custom hook managing garden data and filter conversion
- `components/Database/GardenFilterSelector.tsx`: UI component for garden filter selection
- Updated `app/(tabs)/plants/index.tsx`: Integrated garden filtering with existing plant database
- Automatic filter application on first garden creation
- Clear visual indicators for applied garden filters

**User Experience Improvements:**

- First garden created becomes default filter automatically
- Multiple gardens show as quick filter options
- "Auto" badge indicates which garden is default
- "All Plants" option to clear garden filters
- Status message shows when garden personalization is active

**Filter Conversion Logic:**
Garden conditions are automatically converted to plant database filters including:

- Light requirements → light conditions
- Soil texture/drainage/pH → soil characteristics
- Plant types → plant categories
- Garden themes → landscape themes
- Wildlife attractions → pollinator preferences
- Resistance challenges → plant hardiness
- Location preferences → landscape locations
- Growth rates → plant growth characteristics
- Maintenance levels → care requirements
- Available space → plant sizing
- Regional preferences → NC regions and USDA zones
- Aesthetic preferences → flower/leaf colors and characteristics

**Follow-up Enhancement Suggestions:**

1. **Smart Filter Recommendations**: Suggest additional filters based on garden conditions
2. **Garden Condition Gaps**: Highlight missing garden information that could improve plant recommendations
3. **Seasonal Adjustments**: Modify filters based on current season and plant care calendar
4. **Plant Success Scoring**: Show compatibility scores for plants based on garden conditions
5. **Garden-Specific Plant Collections**: Create curated collections for each garden type
6. **Predictive Filtering**: Learn from user plant additions to refine filter suggestions
7. **Weather Integration**: Adjust recommendations based on current weather conditions
8. **Maintenance Level Matching**: Filter by user's available time for plant care
9. **Plant Combination Suggestions**: Recommend plants that work well together in specific gardens
10. **Progressive Personalization**: As users add plants, further refine recommendations

**Recent Fixes (January 2025):**

- **Growth Rate OR Logic**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Fixed garden filtering to properly handle multiple growth rate selections with OR logic instead of AND logic. Updated PostgREST syntax to use correct `in.(value1,value2)` format. Users can now select both "Slow" and "Medium" growth rates and see plants that match either criteria, not just the first selected option.

- **Garden Filter Integration**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Moved garden filter functionality inside the FilterModal component for better user experience. Users can now access garden-based filtering through the main filter interface instead of having a separate selector. This consolidates all filtering options in one place and provides a more cohesive filtering experience. Removed the standalone `GardenFilterSelector` component as it's no longer needed.

## Dynamic Plant Task Scheduling Plan (2024-06)

### Overview

We are moving to a dynamic, climate-aware plant task scheduling system. All tasks are tied to a specific plant (user_plant_id) and generated when a plant is added to a garden. The system supports both a full-year plan and dynamic rescheduling based on weather and user actions.

### Scheduling Workflow

1. **Full-Year Seeding on Plant Add**

   - When a user adds a plant, generate all expected tasks (watering, fertilizing, pruning, etc.) for the next 12 months using plant data and climate info.
   - Store all tasks in the `plant_tasks` table with due dates and type.

2. **Rolling Refresh Job**

   - A background job runs daily/hourly, looking ahead 30–60 days.
   - Regenerates or reschedules tasks in that window based on:
     - Weather alerts (rain, frost, heat, etc.)
     - Plant/garden data changes
   - Archives "stale" tasks (past due and not completed).

3. **User-Driven Overrides**

   - If a user marks a task complete or reschedules it, the system respects this and does not override it in future refreshes.

4. **UI Feedback & Exports**
   - Calendar view shows both original (planned) and dynamically updated tasks.
   - Dynamic tasks are visually distinct and include tooltips for context (e.g., "Updated for tomorrow's frost warning").
   - Users can export upcoming tasks (PDF/CSV).

### Database Changes Required

- Expand allowed `task_type` values in `plant_tasks` (beyond Water/Fertilize/Harvest).
- Add the following fields to `plant_tasks`:
  - `archived` (boolean): for auto-archived/stale tasks
  - `source` (text/enum): 'seeded', 'dynamic', 'user' (tracks origin of task)
  - `original_due_date` (timestamptz): for rescheduled tasks
  - `metadata` (jsonb): for weather notes, reschedule reasons, etc.
- No recurrence field needed (tasks are regenerated as needed).

### Implementation Tasks

- [ ] Update `plant_tasks` table schema (add new fields, expand allowed types)
- [ ] Implement full-year task seeding logic on plant add
- [ ] Build rolling refresh background job (daily/hourly)
- [ ] Implement logic to respect user overrides
- [ ] Update UI to distinguish planned vs. dynamic tasks
- [ ] Add export functionality (PDF/CSV)
- [ ] Document new scheduling logic in `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/technical.md`

// Reason: This plan enables flexible, climate-aware, and user-respecting plant care scheduling, supporting both automation and manual control.

## [Planned] Complete Removal of Garden Health Feature (2024-06)

### Rationale

We are removing the "garden health" feature from the app. This feature previously tracked a score or status for each garden, decreasing when users had overdue tasks. With the move to a more dynamic, flexible, and positive user experience (and dynamic task scheduling), punitive or negative feedback is no longer aligned with our product philosophy. Instead, we will focus on positive reinforcement and clear, actionable feedback for users.

### Scope

This is a **major architectural and UX change**. It will affect the database, backend logic, UI components, hooks, tests, and documentation. All references to garden health must be removed or refactored.

### Task Breakdown

1. **Discovery & Impact Assessment**

   - [ ] Search the entire codebase for all references to garden health (e.g., `gardenHealth`, `garden_health`, `health_score`, `setGardenHealth`, etc.).
   - [ ] Identify all UI components, hooks, and utilities that display, calculate, or depend on garden health.
   - [ ] List all database tables and columns related to garden health (likely in `user_gardens` or related tables).
   - [ ] Find all backend/API logic that updates or returns garden health.
   - [ ] Review documentation, onboarding, and tests for garden health references.

2. **Planning the Removal**

   - [ ] Plan SQL migrations to drop garden health columns/tables from Supabase.
   - [ ] Plan refactors/removals for all affected frontend and backend code.
   - [ ] Decide how to fill any UI/UX gaps left by removing garden health (e.g., replace with positive stats, streaks, or nothing).

3. **Implementation**

   - [ ] Write and apply database migrations to remove garden health fields.
   - [ ] Refactor or remove all frontend code (components, hooks, context) that uses garden health.
   - [ ] Remove or update backend logic and API endpoints related to garden health.
   - [ ] Update or remove tests that check garden health logic.
   - [ ] Update onboarding, tooltips, and help text to remove garden health references.

4. **Testing & Validation**

   - [ ] Test all user flows where garden health was previously shown or used.
   - [ ] Ensure no errors, broken UI, or missing feedback.
   - [ ] Validate that the user experience remains positive and clear.

5. **Documentation & Communication**

   - [ ] Update `README.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, and `docs/technical.md` to remove all references to garden health.
   - [ ] Add a migration note in `TASK.md` and/or `PLANNING.md` explaining the rationale and what changed.

6. **Release & Monitor**
   - [ ] Deploy the changes.
   - [ ] Monitor user feedback for confusion or requests for the old feature.

// Reason: This ensures a clean, positive, and modern user experience, and prevents technical debt or confusion from legacy garden health logic.
