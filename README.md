# The Green Thumb App - Filter System

## Overview

The Green Thumb App now features a comprehensive filter system for the Plant Database, allowing users to filter plants by various criteria such as:

- Plant types (Houseplant, Succulent, Vine, etc.)
- Light requirements
- Soil conditions
- And more

## Implementation Details

### Filter Modal

The filter system uses a modal-based approach:

1. Users tap a "Filter" button to open a full-screen modal
2. The modal displays filter categories in collapsible sections
3. Users can select multiple filter options across different categories
4. The modal includes:
   - Search functionality to find specific filters
   - Quick filters for common use cases
   - Advanced filter toggle for more specific options

### Technical Structure

The filter system consists of several components:

- `FilterSelector.tsx`: The main button that opens the filter modal
- `FilterModal.tsx`: The full-screen modal with all filter options
- `filterData.ts`: Data structure defining all available filters

### Using NativeWind

The filter system is styled using NativeWind (TailwindCSS for React Native), providing a consistent and responsive UI.

## How to Use

1. Tap the "Filter" button on the Plant Database screen
2. Browse through filter categories or use the search to find specific filters
3. Select the desired filter options
4. Tap "Apply Filters" to see filtered results

## Future Enhancements

- Save favorite filter combinations
- More advanced filter logic (AND/OR operations)
- Filter history
