## 🎯 Strategic Overview

### Vision Statement

**"Build a collaborative AI system where hyper-specialized agents work together to deliver expert-level plant care guidance, starting lean and scaling intelligently."**

### MVP Focus Areas

Based on user interview findings and current app priorities, our initial agents will focus on:

- **Plant Database Curation:** Address user feedback that "4500+ plants is overwhelming" by providing intelligent filtering
- **Smart Plant Recommendations:** Solve the #1 user request for "recommended plants after garden creation"
- **Task Scheduling Intelligence:** Enhance existing AI task generation with multi-plant coordination
- **User Anxiety Reduction:** Address "Anxious Plant Parent" persona with nurturing, confidence-building guidance

### User-Driven Priorities (From Interview Findings)

- **Critical:** "Database not scrollable" and "overwhelming plant options" require intelligent curation
- **High Priority:** "No plant recommendations after garden creation" drives immediate business value
- **Enhancement:** "Smart plant recommendations based on garden conditions" transforms user experience

### Integration with Existing Systems

- **Database:** Leverage existing Supabase schemas for inter-agent communication
- **Task Generation Replacement:** Replace current Edge Function with intelligent multi-agent task orchestration
- **Plant Database:** Use existing 1000+ plant database as knowledge foundation
- **User Journey:** Integrate seamlessly with current app flows while improving core task generation logic

## 🏗️ Technical Foundation

### **Critical: Data Schema Validation (Phase 0 Priority)**

**Problem:** Prevent agent overlap by defining precise data contracts before parallel development

```typescript
// PHASE 0: Lock down these schemas before building agents
interface GardenConditions {
  // Environmental factors
  sunlight_hours: number; // 2-12 hours daily
  sunlight_quality: "full" | "partial" | "shade";
  soil_type: "clay" | "sand" | "loam" | "mixed";
  soil_drainage: "poor" | "moderate" | "excellent";
  soil_ph: number; // 4.0-9.0

  // Climate factors
  usda_zone: string; // "6a", "7b", etc.
  average_temp_low: number; // Fahrenheit
  average_temp_high: number; // Fahrenheit
  humidity_level: "low" | "moderate" | "high";

  // Space constraints
  available_space: "small" | "medium" | "large"; // <10, 10-50, 50+ sq ft
  container_gardening: boolean;
  indoor_outdoor: "indoor" | "outdoor" | "both";
}

interface PlantRecommendation {
  plant_id: number; // Reference to plant_full_data
  confidence_score: number; // 0.0-1.0
  compatibility_reasons: string[]; // ["matches soil type", "thrives in partial shade"]
  care_difficulty: "beginner" | "intermediate" | "advanced";
  estimated_success_rate: number; // 0.0-1.0 based on garden conditions
  seasonal_notes?: string; // Optional timing recommendations
}

interface UserPreferences {
  experience_level: "beginner" | "intermediate" | "advanced";
  time_commitment: "low" | "moderate" | "high"; // <30min, 30-60min, 60+ min/week
  plant_types: string[]; // ["vegetables", "flowers", "herbs", "houseplants"]
  maintenance_preference: "low" | "moderate" | "high";
  budget_range?: "low" | "moderate" | "high"; // Optional
}
```

### **Inter-Agent Communication Protocol**

**Schema:** Extend existing Supabase database schemas for agent coordination

```typescript
// Agent Communication Interface
interface AgentMessage {
  id: string;
  from_agent: string;
  to_agent: string;
  message_type: "request" | "response" | "broadcast";
  data: Record<string, any>;
  created_at: string;
}

// Plant Recommendation Request
interface PlantRecommendationRequest {
  garden_id: string;
  user_preferences?: UserPreferences;
  existing_plants: UserPlant[];
  garden_conditions: GardenConditions;
  budget_range?: number;
  space_constraints?: SpaceConstraints;
}

// Care Schedule Request
interface CareScheduleRequest {
  user_plant_id: string;
  plant_data: PlantData;
  garden_conditions: GardenConditions;
  user_schedule_preferences?: SchedulePreferences;
  existing_tasks?: PlantTask[];
}
```

### **Knowledge Base Architecture**

**RAG Implementation:** Pinecone or Supabase Vector for semantic search

```typescript
// Knowledge Document Structure
interface KnowledgeDocument {
  id: string;
  agent_id: string;
  title: string;
  content: string;
  embeddings: number[];
  metadata: {
    version: string;
    last_updated: string;
    topic_tags: string[];
    confidence_score?: number;
  };
}
```

### **Caching Strategy**

**Iterative Caching:** Start simple, add layers based on usage patterns

**Phase 0:** Memory-only caching for proof of concept
**Phase 1:** Add Redis/database layers only if Phase 0 shows high cache miss rates

1. **L1 Cache (Memory):** Common plant recommendations (5 min TTL)
2. **L2 Cache (Redis):** _Optional_ - Add if Phase 0 shows need for complex garden analyses
3. **L3 Cache (Database):** _Optional_ - Add if Phase 0 shows value in historical agent outputs

---

## 💰 Cost & Performance Strategy

### **Model Selection Strategy**

**Optimize cost vs. capability based on task complexity**

```typescript
// AI Model Router
interface ModelRoutingStrategy {
  "simple-recommendations": "gpt-3.5-turbo"; // $0.002/1k tokens
  "complex-analysis": "gpt-4"; // $0.03/1k tokens
  "scientific-research": "gpt-o3"; // $0.06/1k tokens (80% cheaper)
  "bulk-processing": "gpt-3.5-turbo"; // $0.002/1k tokens
}
```

### **Cost Monitoring & Controls**

**Phase 0:** Basic token usage tracking and manual monitoring
**Phase 1:** Advanced monitoring based on Phase 0 learnings

- **Budget Alerts:** Start with simple daily spend alerts, add per-agent monitoring if needed
- **Usage Analytics:** Track cost per user, validate <$0.50/month target
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement if Phase 0 shows runaway cost risk
- **Caching ROI:** Monitor cache hit rates only if multi-layer caching is implemented

### **Performance Targets**

- **Response Time:** <300ms for single-agent queries
- **Multi-Agent Coordination:** <800ms for complex task delegation
- **Availability:** 99.9% uptime for agent services
- **Throughput:** Support 1000+ concurrent users
