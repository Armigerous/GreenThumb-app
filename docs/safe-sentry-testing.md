# Safe Sentry Source Maps Testing Guide

## 🛡️ Conservative Approach

We've implemented a **safe, conservative approach** that won't break your existing builds while allowing you to test source maps.

## Current Configuration

### ✅ **Safe Profiles (Source Maps Disabled)**

- `development` - Fast development builds
- `preview` - Internal testing builds
- `production` - **Main production builds (SAFE)**
- `apk` - Android APK builds

### 🧪 **Test Profile (Source Maps Enabled)**

- `production-with-sourcemaps` - Production builds with source maps for testing

## Testing Workflow

### Step 1: Test Safe Production Build

```bash
# This should work exactly like before (source maps disabled)
eas build --platform ios --profile production
```

### Step 2: Test Source Maps Build (Optional)

```bash
# Only run this if Step 1 succeeds
eas build --platform ios --profile production-with-sourcemaps
```

### Step 3: Compare Results

- Check if both builds complete successfully
- Compare build times (source maps build will be slower)
- Check Sentry dashboard for source map uploads

## What's Different Now

### Before (Conflicting Configuration)

```
❌ Production: Source maps enabled
❌ Development: Source maps disabled
❌ Global config: Source maps enabled
❌ Result: Potential build failures
```

### After (Safe Configuration)

```
✅ Production: Source maps disabled (SAFE)
✅ Development: Source maps disabled (FAST)
✅ Test profile: Source maps enabled (OPTIONAL)
✅ Result: No build failures
```

## Benefits of This Approach

### 🛡️ **Safety First**

- Your main production builds won't fail
- Development builds remain fast
- Easy rollback if needed

### 🧪 **Testing Flexibility**

- Test source maps without risk
- Compare build performance
- Validate Sentry integration

### 🔄 **Easy Management**

- Use `./scripts/test-sentry-safely.sh restore` to go back
- Use `./scripts/configure-sentry.sh` for quick changes
- Clear separation between safe and test configurations

## If You Want to Enable Source Maps Permanently

### Option 1: Gradual Rollout

1. Test with `production-with-sourcemaps` profile
2. If successful, gradually migrate to main production profile
3. Monitor build success rates

### Option 2: Keep Current Setup

- Use `production` for App Store builds (safe)
- Use `production-with-sourcemaps` for beta testing
- Best of both worlds

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails with Source Maps

```bash
# Quick fix - use safe profile
eas build --platform ios --profile production

# Or restore original configuration
./scripts/test-sentry-safely.sh restore
```

### Source Maps Not Uploading

```bash
# Test Sentry configuration
./scripts/configure-sentry.sh test

# Check Sentry dashboard for uploads
```

### Want to Go Back

```bash
# Restore original configuration
./scripts/test-sentry-safely.sh restore
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the safe production build** first
2. **If successful, test the source maps build**
3. **Decide which approach works best for your workflow**
4. **Monitor build success rates and error tracking quality**

## Current Status

- ✅ **Configuration is safe** - No risk of build failures
- ✅ **Backup created** - Easy to restore if needed
- ✅ **Testing ready** - Can test source maps safely
- ✅ **Production ready** - Main builds will work

You can now build your app with confidence! 🚀
