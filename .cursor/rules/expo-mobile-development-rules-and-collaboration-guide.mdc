# Cursor Development Rules & AI Collaboration Guide – Expo Mobile App Edition

> SDK Version: 50+ (2025) – Managed Workflow  
> Project Docs: `README.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/technical.md`, `tasks/tasks.md`

## 📜 Core Philosophy

1. **Simplicity:** Favor clear, composable solutions. Avoid unnecessary logic or styling complexity.
2. **Iterate:** Improve upon working code unless there's a clear reason to rewrite. Changes should be additive or evolutionary.
3. **Focus:** Complete the task in scope using the architecture and patterns defined in `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/technical.md`.
4. **Quality:** Prioritize clean, maintainable, and performant mobile code with Expo best practices.
5. **Collaboration:** Maintain project alignment through careful adherence to documentation and update it where needed.

---

## 📚 Project Context & Understanding

1. **Documentation First:**
   * Before beginning a task, review:
     * `README.md` – project overview, stack, base conventions
     * `docs/architecture.md` – app structure, data flow, screen/component relationships
     * `docs/technical.md` – specific patterns (e.g. navigation, styling, data fetching)
     * `tasks/tasks.md` – currently scoped task definitions
   * If documentation is unclear, missing, or inconsistent, **stop and ask for clarification** before continuing.

2. **Architecture Adherence:**
   * Use only file structure and data flow patterns approved in `docs/architecture.md`.
   * Do not introduce cross-module dependencies without architecture update and review.
   * Example folders: `screens/`, `components/`, `features/`, `lib/`, `hooks/`, `constants/`.

3. **Pattern & Tech Stack Awareness:**
   * Follow patterns in `docs/technical.md` — this includes animation conventions, gesture handling, form control, and utility layers.
   * Use established libraries from `README.md` before proposing new ones.
   * For Expo-specific work (e.g. camera, permissions, routing), refer to documented approaches before inventing new ones.

## ⚙️ Task Execution & Workflow

1. **Task Definition:**
   * Tasks are assigned via `tasks/tasks.md`. Confirm their status before beginning.
   * Confirm all requirements are present, and validate dependencies or blockers with the team if needed.

2. **Change Protocol:**
   * Review affected modules using `docs/architecture.md`.
   * Plan changes using task acceptance criteria and patterns in `docs/technical.md`.
   * Isolate feature-specific changes. Avoid global refactoring unless explicitly requested.

3. **Progress Tracking:**
   * Update status and issues in `docs/status.md`.
   * When a task is complete or blocked, mark it in `tasks/tasks.md` with reasoning or next steps.

---

## 🤖 AI Collaboration & Prompting

1. **Be Clear and Contextual:**
   * Prompt with file paths, expected behavior, and edge case examples when possible.

2. **Reference Existing Docs:**
   * Mention if the request builds on something in `docs/technical.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, or a specific section of `README.md`.

3. **Use Prompt Directives:**
   * `"Suggestion:"` for exploratory or multi-option help.
   * `"Applying fix:"` for directly adding well-scoped logic that aligns with existing patterns.

4. **Break Large Tasks Down:**
   * For animations, onboarding, or gesture handling: break into components/screens and confirm behavior incrementally.

---

## ✨ Code Quality & Style

1. **Strict Typing:** All files must be typed. No `any`, even temporarily.
2. **Expo-Specific Design:**
   * Use `KeyboardAvoidingView`, `SafeAreaView`, and `useSafeAreaInsets()` appropriately.
   * Avoid scroll misuse. Use `FlatList` for scrollable content.

3. **File Organization:**
   * Cap screen and component files to 300 lines.
   * Prefer smaller, purpose-driven components for testability.

4. **Linting & Format:**
   * Follow ESLint/Prettier settings in the repo.
   * Naming should reflect purpose, not intent (e.g., no `MyComponentImproved.tsx`).

---

## ♻️ Refactoring

1. **Intentional Only:**
   * Refactor only when part of a defined task, or when improving adjacent code to complete it effectively.

2. **Check All Callers:**
   * After changes, run through all components, screens, or hooks relying on the updated code. Cross-reference with `docs/architecture.md`.

3. **Avoid Copying:**
   * Modify or abstract logic into utils/hooks. Do not fork files (e.g., no `Modal-v2.tsx`).

---

## ✅ Testing & Validation

1. **Tests Must Be Tied to Task Scope:**
   * Include unit tests for logic utilities.
   * Do not over-test UI unless animation or gesture behavior is critical and tricky to maintain.

2. **Expo Testing Frameworks:**
   * Use `jest-expo` for unit testing.
   * Use manual testing via Expo Go on both iOS and Android for gestures, keyboar. **Bubmitting Work:**
   * Validate the behavior with real interaction. Dark mode, small device screens, and back navigation should not break.

---

## 🐛 Debugging & Troubleshooting

1. **Check Logs:**
   * Run `npx expo logs` on device or simulator for runtime warnings.
   * Clear cache with `npx expo start --clear` if bugs appear after changes.

2. **Expo Known Issues:**
   * Search Expo Forums and GitHub before creating complex fixes. Link findings in `fixes/`.

3. **Document Fixes in Place:**
   * Place persistent issue breakdowns under `fixes/` with clear filename (`fixes/nativeDriver-animation-warning.md`).

---

## 🔒 Security

1. **Expo Permissions:** Follow documented permission flows (camera, location, notifications) from `docs/technical.md`.
2. **Credential Handling:**
   * Use environment variables via `app.config.js`.
   * Never commit secrets. Always provide `.env.example`.

## 🔐 Clerk + Supabase Integration Rules

**CRITICAL:** This project uses Clerk for authentication with Supabase as the database. Follow these rules strictly:

1. **User ID Handling:**
   * Clerk user IDs are TEXT strings (e.g., `user_2tj0mC9c8UaPRPo77HUDAQ9ZEs5`), NOT UUIDs
   * All `user_id` columns in database tables MUST be `TEXT NOT NULL`, never `UUID`
   * Never use `auth.uid()` in RLS policies - it returns Supabase UUIDs, not Clerk IDs

2. **RLS Policies - ALWAYS use `requesting_user_id()`:**
   ```sql
   -- ✅ CORRECT - Use requesting_user_id() for Clerk integration
   CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own data" ON table_name FOR
   SELECT USING (requesting_user_id() = user_id);
   
   -- ❌ WRONG - Never use auth.uid() with Clerk
   CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own data" ON table_name FOR
   SELECT USING (auth.uid()::text = user_id);
   ```

3. **Database Schema Requirements:**
   * All user-owned tables must have `user_id TEXT NOT NULL` 
   * The `requesting_user_id()` function must exist in the database
   * RLS policies must use `requesting_user_id() = user_id` pattern

4. **Migration Standards:**
   * When creating new tables with user ownership, always use `requesting_user_id()` in RLS policies
   * Test RLS policies with actual Clerk user IDs before deployment
   * Document any new user-owned tables in `docs/architecture.md`

5. **Error Prevention:**
   * If you see "invalid input syntax for type uuid" errors, check RLS policies immediately
   * Always verify user ID format matches Clerk's string format, not UUID format
   * When in doubt, reference existing working tables like `user_subscriptions` or `user_usage`

---

## 🌳 Version Control & Environment

1. **.env Discipline:**
   * Never commit actual `.env`. Only provide `.env.example`.

2. **Expo-Specific Commits:**
   * Keep OTA support stable. When updating `app.json` (e.g. version bump), make sure CI/CD flows remain functional.

3. **Branch Naming:**
   * Use `feature/mobile-[scope]`, `bugfix/mobile-[issue]`, `refactor/mobile-[area]`.

---

## 📄 Documentation Maintenance

1. **Always Update Docs:**
   * Update `docs/architecture.md` for component hierarchy or data flow changes.
   * Update `docs/technical.md` when a new reusable pattern, animation, or hook is introduced.
   * Update `tasks/tasks.md` and `docs/status.md` for task tracking and progress.

2. **Keep This File Current:**
   * Review `.cursorrules` when Expo upgrades (e.g., SDK bump), new docs are added, or patterns evolve.
